# Beancount-Reporter
Create PDF reports from your beancount data

I'm a great fan of beancount - but I miss my monthly reports, that I could check in the ages before beancount with excel.

I've checked the existing beancount-reporting solutions:
- fava
- beancount-multiperiod-reports

... but somehow they don't match my requirements.

Dont get me wrong: Fava is great for day-to-day use, but not to generate PDF reports.
